This  project focused on developing a robust fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. Leveraging machine learning classification techniques, we've created a model that accurately identifies fraudulent activities, ensuring the security and integrity of digital toll transactions.

Project Highlights:

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed a dataset of 5000 rows and 13 columns.

Identified an imbalance in the target variable, with over 80% of data in one class.

Utilized various visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships.

🛠️ Feature Engineering:

Created new features such as date, day, month, fastag, and part of the day.

Dropped less insightful features to streamline the model.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing:

Addressed missing values and scaled data using the Min-Max scaler.

Encoded categorical features and handled class imbalance with SMOTE.

🤖 Modeling:

Built classification models using Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms.

Employed GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

📈 Model Evaluation:

Achieved an impressive ROC-AUC score of 99%, with high accuracy, precision, and recall.

🚀 Deployment:

Successfully saved and deployed the well-performing model.

Our scalable and efficient Fastag fraud detection system helps minimize financial losses and enhances the security of digital toll transactions.
